## Challenges and Lessons

### 1. React environment without CRA(Create-React-App)

I build React environment setting without CRA to understand how each library and file work.

To read more, please check the file [**README-setting**](./README-setting.md)

### 2. File structure setting

Details: [Basic interaction planning](#basic-interaction-planning)

### SVG icon transformation

- Select the desired icon from the React-Icons site, then open developer tools to save the SVG portion.
- Search "SVG to ICO" or "PNG to ICO" on Google.
- Use one of the sites to convert the file to ICO format and save it.
- If it's an SVG file, you can modify the code to set or change the color as needed.
